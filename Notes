Setting up ISP connections:

Martin,

I've managed to ISP program the lpc812 on the Xpresso board, here are my notes:

Separate the lpc812 target from the LPC-link: wipe over the solder shorts between the pins of J4 with a bit of solder wick.

Solder an 8-pin header to J7.

Connect J7-1 to GND, J7-3 to 3v3, board should run. Takes about 8mA running the Blinky demo app.

Connect J7-4 to TXD and J7-5 to RXD of a 3V3 serial port.
NOTE: TXD/RXD are from the point of view of the external serial device, not the lpc812.

Connect a button or jumper between J7-7 and J7-8, this is the ISP enable switch.

I used an FTDI FT2232H mini-module to connect to TXD/RXD and provide the 3V3 power, mainly because I had one lying around.....

It would have been better if Reset had been connected to J7 as well....

ISP protocol has definitely changed and it looks like (CR)(LF) is required to terminate commands.
Data is sent plain binary, Not UUENCODED, and there is no checksum.

Clock frequency is always 12MHz, the bootloader uses the internal RC oscillator.

I've attached the very hacky python script I used to program the device, it may be of some use...
